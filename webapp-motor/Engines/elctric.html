          <h2>Quick Info</h2>
          <p>It may be you heard about an electric engine. Its the new rising star in the automotive industry.
          Its highly apraised by experts and ecologist because its really good for the environment. But the
          car culture is quite now not on the side of the electric engine because its missing the beloved sound
          and "feel" of combustion engine they say.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text1">
                      <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The first electric motors were simple electrostatic devices described in experiments by Scottish monk Andrew Gordon and
            American experimenter Benjamin Franklin in the 1740s. The theoretical principle behind them, Coulomb's law, was
            discovered but not published, by Henry Cavendish in 1771. This law was discovered independently by Charles-Augustin de
            Coulomb in 1785, who published it so that it is now known with his name.The invention of the electrochemical battery
            by Alessandro Volta in 1799 made possible the production of persistent electric currents. After the discovery of the
            interaction between such a current and a magnetic field, namely the electromagnetic interaction by Hans Christian Ørsted
            in 1820 much progress was soon made. It only took a few weeks for André-Marie Ampère to develop the first formulation of
            the electromagnetic interaction and present the Ampère's force law, that described the production of mechanical force by
           the interaction of an electric current and a magnetic field. The first demonstration of the effect with a rotary motion
           was given by Michael Faraday in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet
           (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current
            gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments,
            substituting brine for (toxic) mercury. Barlow's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, although
            these and similar homopolar motors remained unsuited to practical application until late in the century.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text1">
              <p>In 1827, Hungarian physicist Ányos Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic coils. After Jedlik solved the technical
            problems of continuous rotation with the invention of the commutator, he called his early devices "electromagnetic self-rotors".
            Although they were used only for teaching, in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of
            practical DC motors: the stator, rotor and commutator. The device employed no permanent magnets, as the magnetic fields of both
            the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text1">
            <p>The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891.[45] By 1896, General
            Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called
            the squirrel-cage rotor. Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were
            such that a 100-horsepower (HP) induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions
            as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897</p>

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>When depleted, the batteries are recharged using grid electricity, either from a wall socket or a dedicated charging unit.
            Since they don’t run on gasoline or diesel and are powered entirely by electricity, battery electric cars and trucks
            are considered “all-electric” vehicles</p>
          </div>
.         <div class="text1">
              <p> When driven, BEVs don’t produce tailpipe pollution—they don’t even have a tailpipe.
                  However, the electricity they use may produce heat-trapping gases and other pollution at the source of its generation
                  or in the extraction of fossil fuels. The amount of pollution produced depends on how the electricity is made. In the
                      United States, battery electric cars charged off the dirtiest coal-dominated grid still produce less pollution than their
                  gasoline-powered counterparts. BEVs powered by renewable energy sources like wind or solar are virtually emission-free.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text1">
          <p>Not using gasoline or diesel also means that battery electric cars are significantly cheaper to fuel than conventional
          vehicles. Exact comparisons depend on the vehicle model and fuel prices, but driving a BEV can save drivers over $1,000
          annually in gasoline money.</p>
