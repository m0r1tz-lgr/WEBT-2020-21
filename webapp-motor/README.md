# webapp-motor
What we would like to do:

Our idea for a web-app would be to implement a car race or let's say car-game to our webtsite.
We have thought about serverel different versions for it.
One would be pretty similar to the mobile game hill climb racing and the other approach would
be similar to the show which is used at the TADOT at our school to teach programming.


In let's call it the "hill climb" version, the user can excalerate the car with d and brake with a
In the other version the user can controll the car to go left by pressing a and right with d
to avoid hitting obsticles that are randomly generated.
