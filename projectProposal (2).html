      <h1>Introduction</h2>
      <h2>Why did we decide on this topic</h2>
      <p> Why? thats a good question. The answer is pretty simple. The both of us are slowly
      <p> turning into an age, where cars play a very imortant role in our lifes. First of all it's just
      <p> cool having your own car but its also the most important transportation method at this stage of
      <p> our lifes. So we thought about how the engines behind our belove cars actually worked and thats
      <p> when we came up with the idea for this page.
      </p>

      <h2>What's up with the static site?</h2>
      <p> There are so many differences between electrical cars and other.
      <p> Our static site will compare the differences.
      </p>

      <h2>Team</h2>
      <p>
        At the start of this project we are a two-man-organization.
        Me <a>Luca Fuchsjäger</a> and my partner <a>Moritz Lagler</a>
        are two highly motivated programmers, just waiting for a new challenge.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is intended to be a project for our school (<a href="https://www.htl-leonding.at/">HTBLA Leonding</a>),
        Because of this there is no monetization planned and the product will be open
        source on <a href="https://github.com/m0r1tz-lgr/WEBT-2020-21">our organizations github</a>
        However we also have some personal interests in Engines and would really like to see it becomming a success.
        In this case we would also maintain it after the submissions.

      <h1>Technical and lawfull requirements and restrictions</h1>
      <h2>Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        If our "Comparing Eninge" would be released to the public, we would need an Imprint
        as well as a privacy document in compliance with the DSGVO of the EU.
        Because we're both minors and our parents wouldn't agree to stating our
        names, adress and phone number in public.

      <h1>Goals</h1>

      <h2>Dynamic WebT Part</h2>
      <p>
        On the landing page you'll see electrical cars and others. Also you will see the comparing part.
        We will try to be as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but not least, we will try to create a game where you can drive with a car and get a highscore.
      </p>
      <h2>Personal goals</h2>
      <p>
        We hope to learn and expand our knowledge
        in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL-Databases, web-APIs and much more.
        we would also be happy to inspire others for this topic.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>Planning</h1>

      <h2>Who will be our users?</h2>
      <p>
        People that like cars, engines and others.
      </p>

      <h2>Important milestones</h2>
      <p>
        The next important thing (after this project-proposal) will be to recherche and code the static site. After that is done,
        we'll start with the dynamic part. There we'll begin with exploring electrical cars.
        With this knowledge in mind we'll program other page. When that is done we'll implement
        the comparing page. And last but not least we'll do everything to make it more beautiful and we'll try to programm a game.
      </p>
