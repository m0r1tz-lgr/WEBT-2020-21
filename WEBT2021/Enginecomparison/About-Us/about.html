      <h2>Why did we decide on this topic?</h2>
      <p>Why? Thats a good question. The answer is pretty simple. The both of us are slowly turning into an age,</p>
      <p>where cars play a very importantrole in our lifes. First of all it's just cool having your own car </p>
      <p>but its also the most important transportation method at this stage of our lifes. </p>
      <p>So we thougth about how the engines behind our beloved cars actually worked and thats when we came up</p>
      <p>with the idea for this page.</p>
      <h2>Whats going to be on the page?</h2>
      <p>So as you might see up in the navigation bar, the main points we want to discuss are already there.</p>
      <p>There will be a page for the two different types of engines and one for the comparison off the two.</p>
      <p>On the page for the comparison we also plan on implementing our web application.Just now we couldn't</p>
      <p>decide on what application we want to do but thats soon to come to this page. If you want to you have</p>
      <p>fun and explore our page.</p>
